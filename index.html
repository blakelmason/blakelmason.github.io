                                Grew up in Huntington Beach, CA. Really enjoy the beach. Warm weather and good waves, doesn't get much better than that.
                                Grew up playing lots of sports and I did pole vault in high school and college. I don't know
                                why I did pole vault, looking back it was INSANE! When I was 19 I went on a Mormon mission in
                                Europe for two years and I learned how to speak French fluently. Yes, I also ate lots of cheese
                                there. They have good cheese. Went to college at BYU in Utah and that's where I met my wife,
                                Kenzie.

                                Before I met my wife I learned country swing dance and took some ballroom dance classes. My first date with my wife I took
                                her out country swing dancing and it was awesome. I still love dancing and I want to learn more
                                partner dances. The latin ones sound fun, like salsa and bachata.

                                Right now I have a baby daughter, her name is Rosalie. I also just began a coding bootcamp at UC Irvine. It is really fast
                                paced, but I don't mind because the material is very interesting. By now you are probably thinking
                                that it's good for me to learn coding, because a writing career is definitely not in my future.
